				<p>Hello, my name is Dakota and I am a senior at Bartlett High School. I am originally from Datyon, Ohio but I moved to Tennessee when I was 13. I certainly hated moving away from my friends and family in Ohio but luckily I had family members in Tennessee that went to the same school as I was, so it was a pretty easy transfer since I knew someone. 
					I never really participated in extra curricular activites outside of school because I just wanted to focus on school. Now that I am a senior, I kinda do and don't regret not participating in extra curricular activites becuase I realized they look good on your college application but at the same time I don't know if I would be able to do both and pass with a good GPA. I like to mess around with computers in my spare time as in fixing, building, or even looking online for good deals on PC parts. I even built my own computer so I guess it's a "hobby" of mine. I hope to attend The Ohio State University and study computer engineering after I graduate high school. Computer engineering is also what I want to get a job in because I have been fascinated with computers and how they work for as long as I can remember. I also want to be up to date with current technology so when I get old im not that one guy that doesn't know how to work the technology.
